# Dorothea
Group 3 - Dorothea dataset


Hi Guys, Found this, print((doros == 1).sum()) it lists all of the rows and the number of 1s in them, so we should then be able to remove the rows with no 1s. Although i am worried i may have already lost the column which states if the row is a sucesfull durg. I suspect that some rows are marked as a negative drug, although they will match sucessfull drugs, and that some are marked as positive, but are not. Paul
